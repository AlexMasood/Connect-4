# Connect-4
Simple command line connect 4 game featuring a ai taught through reinforcement learning.

Training an ai on the 6 by 7 standard connnect 4 grid takes too long to make any meaningful training.\
A potential solution to this is to train on a 4 by 4 grid and apply this 12 times on the grid for each possible time a 4 by 4 grid can appear on a 6 by 7 grid.\
About to get a new cpu and will do a redo of training
